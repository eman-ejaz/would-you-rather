# Would You Rather?

This is the final project in the Udacity's React Nano Degree.

The project aims to use all the knowledge we have covered in the nanodegree so far, which primarily includes React and Redux.

Using the skill we have established throughout the program we are to develop a game named "Would You Rather?"

The game inclueds: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option One] or [option Two] ?”. You can't mark both the options neither can you leave it unmarked. In the app the user would be able to see all the answers he/she has marked and all the unanswered questions as well in their separate respective tab panels.

## TL;DR
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the app with `npm start`
* access the app on http://localhost:3000/ (if the port 3000 is not already occupied.)

## Backend Server

Udacity has provided a backend server for this project. The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) contains the code for the API calls.

## Important

With the backend being only pseudo, the data is not persistent on refresh.
